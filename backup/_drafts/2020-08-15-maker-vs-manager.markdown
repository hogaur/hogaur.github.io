Dont mix the jobs Of A maker and A manager
A lesson from the first five years of a career into engineering

Most of us dream. Imagine I told you there was a place where you could start working and start growing as soon as you joined. There you could build products and solve problems like never before. You could devise policies and reporting structures. Most of you would agree with me on this: those who have worked with early-age startups as well as those who have been observing the ecosystem for a while, startups give exposure to this opportunity to its fullest to a person early in their career. That's why I believe startups are such a hype. But there is a hugh threat that comes along with this great opportunity.

The threat of making the same mistakes as made by others before in the industry. The lack of mentorship only adds more fear to this threat. While all this means that you learn to swim on your own and learn to conquer the seas, it also means that you could get just lost and end up in whirlpool.

Maker's job responsibility is to take care of all the edge cases that are going to be there that will make him wake up on a Sunday morning. So that he can at least gets to enjoy a weekend with the family. 
And my friend suggested this blog that I read and thought will share with a wider audience someday along with my own thoughts. Go give it a read if you haven't already.
