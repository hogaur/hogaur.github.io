Looping

Functions functions everywhere

Clojure has superpowers when it comes to functions. You could define a function. Wait what, we do that in all the languages dont we?
Yes you are right. In Clojure, you can also pass functions as an argument, return function from a function and also make function to create functions.

Code is data! Data is Code!
Who talks like that? Morpheus from the movie Matrix is that you? Or I just landed into a dream from the movie Inception. And What is the deal with it?

Is immutability a curse?
Rather, A blessing in disguise.
So have we got no variables? Who will join me into this journey to awesomeness then asked Frodo.

Which IDE to use?
I use vim. Many Clojure enthusiasts are also seasoned emacs practitioners. A lot of my friends really like the cursive support in IntelliJ. And Visual Basic Code is nowadays the kubernetes of IDE world, so you could use Code as well. My Vim setup includes, fireplace.vim, rainbow parentheses plugin to be noted and you could follow a guide mentioned at the end of the blog if setting up vim for Clojure development is your goal.

Who ate the semicolons?
And where have all the dots gone?

Consitency in code structure makes Clojure very easy to follow.

I am sure you could follow this entire blog post if you had never read Clojure before.

Wait but why Clojure?
Here are some of the reasons you might want to use Clojure.

I have been writing Clojure for past three years on and off at work. And currently lead the team that has written the event-sourcing application framework, Ziggurat. At Gojek, more than 250 applications run in producvtion that leverage the power of this framework to consume, process millions of events every minute to deliver business value.
