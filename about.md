I am a Software Developer and work at <a href="ttp://codeignition.co"
target="_blank">Codeignition</a>. 
Sufi-mystics inspire me. I often feel connected with the
meaning of life as described in sufi songs and poetry.
<br>
Born and brought up in Bikaner, Rajasthan, IN; I did my schooling
from H.S.R. Vidyaniketan and R.S.V. Sr. Sec. School and then went on to do B.Tech in CSE from IIT Jodhpur.
<br>
During college I used to performed with a five-piece band. We wrote
a few compositions but we mostly covered other artists. I write often, mostly in Hindi. I find great depth in the writings of Ghalib. His works continue to surprise me till
this very day.
