Sufi-mystics inspire me. I often feel connected with the
meaning of life as described in sufi songs and poetry. Music has been in
my life since my childhood, in form of songs that my mother and sisters
used to sing to me as lullaby or in form chants, bhajans and Bollywood
songs that used to play early in the morning on All India Radio. I
remember participating in Solo-singing competetion when I was in first
standard. I sang 'Saras Bano', a poem by Gurudev RabindraNath Tagore. I
experimented a little bit with Keyboard, Flute and Hindustani Classical
Vocals but did not succeed to contrinue or convert what I started. I
want to learn to play at least one instrument efficiently.
My interest towards poetry rose during my school education while writing
भाषा-सौंदर्य and काव्य-सौंदर्य (beauty of language and poetry) for hindi poems.
Later my interest grew towards sufism and by the time I graduated I had
started listening and reading a lot of sufi literature. I find great
depth in the writings of Ghalib. His works continue to surprise me till
this very day.
I am a developer and I work at Codeignition. My introduction to
programming happened as late as in life during my freshman year in
graduation. I mostly work in web technologies and a bit of DevOps,
credits to my workplace where we live DevOps culture.
During my graduation I performed with a five-piece college band. Back
then, nothing gave me more pleasure than performing at stage and I want
to continue performing, let's see how.
I am born and brought up in Bikaner, Rajasthan, IN. I did my schooling
from H.S.R. Vidyaniketan and R.S.V. Sr. Sec. School. I completed my gradaution (B.Tech CSE) from
Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur in 2015.
