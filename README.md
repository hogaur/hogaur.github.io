This is my new jekyll based personal blog. I have picked up a theme from
internet.

Settings
---

* jekyll - 4.0.0
* Theme - [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
* Other settings - `_config.yml`

Dev Setup
---

* Install gem dependencies - `bundle install`
* Start local server at 4000 port - `jekyll serve`
* Restart the local server after changing setting in `_config.yml`

Issues
---

[] ERROR '/favicon.ico' not found.
Happens when I hit localhost:4000 after starting the dev server in my
local. Doesn't happen when I reload the page, restart the server or open
the blog in incognito window.
