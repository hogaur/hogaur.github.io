This is my new jekyll based personal blog. I have picked up a theme from
internet.

Dev Setup
---

* setup jekyll
* start local server at 4000 port - `jekyll serve`

Issues
---

[] ERROR '/favicon.ico' not found.
Happens when I hit localhost:4000 after starting the dev server in my
local. Doesn't happen when I reload the page, restart the server or open
the blog in incognito window.
