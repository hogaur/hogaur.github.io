*Gojek has a culture of writing user manuals, after much procastination finally writing one (shamelessly copied from a friend atm).*

*Sep20 5-minute read*

#### Conditions I like to work in
- I love to chat over breaks. Coffee, Trends, Books get me started.
* I like to work with dashboards and terminals around me.
+ I like to take notes, in a bullet points format, when focused.

#### The times/Hours I like to work

- I start my day around 9:30 AM IST, and close around 6 AM IST.
- I like *timeboxing* efforts and iterate over small cycles.
- I am mostly a night owl.
- I am currently on manager time, so my day is filled with interrupts. Still figuring out how I can get some focused time, with high productivity.
- I don’t mind being contacted at any time but I will likely only respond during week daytimes
- I typically workout and meditate post office hours.
- My Calendar is open and accessible so everyone can see my availability. I don’t mind people booking things in my calendar if I am free
- Is there a production outage going on? Let's join a call. *eh, not on the weekends, eh*.
- Wherever applicable, I try to apply the mightiest of the mightest *Rule of Three*.

#### The best ways to communicate with me

- Slack is the quickest way to get a response from me, with upto a few hours of response time.
- Call me on "+91800357...." in case of work related or personal emergencies.
- I keep on top of my emails each week and usually respond within a few days at the latest.

#### The ways I like to receive feedback

- I’d rather have difficult conversations than things be unspoken or unauthentic, so just be straight-forward with me
- I like receiving feedback face-to-face
- I like receiving feedback better when called out so. "Hey #whateveryouwannacallme, I have a feedback to share", is usually a very good start for me.
- I see all feedback as a learning opportunity so I like any feedback to include examples and also suggestions on how I / it could be better/different
- I feel examples are the best way to communicate any feedback.
- I like to give and receive guidance explicitely wrapped in a SBI
- sandwitch. No, not the bank. *Situation,Behavior,Impact*
- I am good at receving strong feedbacks.

#### Things I need

- I love discussions with people where we can freely think about what is possible without conditionals. Although I can be intense in such sessions, asking tough questions which may have no clear answers.
- Intent - I am indefinitely optimistic for having and showing intent all
- the time.
- Authenticity - I find it really hard to be around bullshit or inconsistency
- I am learning that Preparation is absolutely important for me. Any meeting is an expensive affair in terms of time. I get annoyed if people are unprepared.
- I need time to reflect and simmer my thoughts.

#### Things I struggle with

- If I don’t understand the wider purpose behind why we are doing something, I find it hard to engage with. For me getting this clarity is absolutely essential.
- I’m an introvert so working “in the open” is something I have to work hard at
- Too much critiquing and logical reasoning drains my energy
- Unnecessary process - I love agile and lean because it is a great way of being transparent and creates a brilliant learning culture, however, it’s not always necessary. I like minimum-viable-process - what is enough for the size of the team, the type of project, the types of people and the types of outputs looking to be created. On the other hand, I find structure and rituals crucial. Process should also be measured through the outcome lens.

#### Things I love

- I visualise myself as a futurist, always thinking about how we are evolving.
- I like hearing what others are working on and connecting up the dots of what we are doing
- A generative, risk-taking culture
- Technology is something that I am always passionate about.
- If I ever do a PhD, it will be in Cognitive sciences, distributed systems or complex networks. For me they all are the same things.

#### Other things to know about me

- I try to be very rational about decision making
- I recently discovered love for tea
- I believe a lot in myself. That somehow makes things actionable and keeps me moving.
- I can get very passionate in discussion, being naturally an aggressive person, my body language can leak so. I may appear angry, but I am not. There is no impact on the relationship for me post a heated debate.
- In meetings I can be too methodical - always delaying on deciding while taking conversation in several directions, so people find me hard to read. If I am not happy I will say so otherwise assume I am fine!
- Fairness really matters to me. If I think someone is not being treated fairly, or someone is having an unfair impact on others, I will find it hard not to call out.
- For me it is extremely important to treat others with empathy and be treated with the saame.

#### My learning goals for 2020

- Improve on Marketing and Networking skills. I always believed that my work would speak for itself, although that has been the case mostly. But a little bit of new elements can unblock growth.
- Write consistently. I feel writing is a thinking exercise. It has helped me clarify my thoughts.
- Pick a hobby. For most of my life, I have treated my hobbies as my work, but sometimes the going gets tough and I will love a break from monotony.
- Start publishing covers. I feel music is the best language to express.
