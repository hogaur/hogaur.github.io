If you ever start wondering,
<br>
Where have this path lead you,
<br>
Of many things that you didn't like so far.
<br>
Know that no path is a great path,
<br>
And keep going.
<br>

</div>
...

<div>
On any journey, tires could flat,
<br>
Planes could crash.
<br>
That doesn't mean we don't take them.
<br>
They could mean many different things,
<br>
Know that there are always some risks,
<br>
And keep going.
<br>

</div>
...

<div>
If you can't spot the fellow wanderers,
<br>
If They are far ahead or lagging behind.
<br>
And you feel alone, it makes you want to cry.
<br>
Know that a pause is as near as you want it to be,
<br>
And keep going.
<br>

</div>
...

<div>
Its hard to see the end when in the middle,
<br>
Impulses work only best at the beginnings.
<br>
And the energy dips when you reach towards the finish line.
<br>
Know that there are many journies out there for you,
<br>
And keep going.
<br>

</div>
...

<div>
And if you are done what you're supposed to do,
<br>
And crossed your lists and pushed your lungs.
<br>
You feel dead in a moment when you are alive,
<br>
Know that you can choose to take a different route,
<br>
And keep going.
<br>

I wrote this small poem a few days back. Sharing this now.
Actions speak louder than words. Not just words but also louder than thoughts, visions,
imaginations or dreams in my opinion. If we don't consciously make effort
towards it, however grand the idea is, it fails to manifest.
<br>
<mark style="background-color: lightgrey">
Repeat that narrative.
<br>
</mark>
And thus you see the constant reminder to keep moving forward. In many different
ways, the urge is to continue down the path. Definitely consider
alternatives but continue making efforts towards the goal.
<br>
<br>

I think, write and create a lot of things on a day to day basis. But I often shy
away from sharing my thoughts out loud. This poem is a small step towards sharing my ideas with a broader audience. For
folks to view, comment, and criticize.
<br>
<br>
Also, my language of choice
for
writing poems has been Hindi primarily over a long time. So,
here I am trying out writing down a small piece in English. Baby Steps
FTW!
:D
