<div>
Let that thought sink in
<br>
Give it the time it takes
<br>
For a seed to become a tree
<br>
Whatever be the stakes.
</div>
...

<div>
Act from a space of clarity
<br>
Revise it and do it often
<br>
Until you have your own narrative
<br>
And demystify it out in the open.
</div>
...

<div>
Go to the public, seek their opinion
<br>
Seek suggestions, so it soothes
<br>
Not only to the one who knows
<br>
But everyone who reads enriches.
</div>

I wrote this small poem a few days back. Sharing this now with the
intent 
indicated in the poem itself, 
<br>
<mark style="background-color: lightgrey">
Revise it and do it often
<br>
And demystify it out in the open.
</mark>
<br>
<br>

I think, write and create a lot of things on a day to day basis. But I often shy
away from sharing my thoughts out loud. This poem is a small step towards sharing my ideas with a broader audience. For
folks to view, comment, and criticize.
<br>
<br>
Also, my language of choice
for
writing poems has been Hindi primarily over a long time. So,
here I am trying out writing down a small piece in English. Baby Steps
FTW!
:D
