Coke Studio season 8 is being aired right now (Read Coke Studio as Coke Studio Pakistan, always!). And here I am listing down my favorites from the first season of the famous
franchise-

</ul>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjF-iRLPIak" target="_blank">Zinda</a>
</ul>
<ul>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acqctXbGM9I" target="_blank">Chal Dil</a>
</ul>
<ul>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpsSkUvlwiE" target="_blank">Allah Hu</a>
</ul>
<ul>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAX8qPw5zBw" target="_blank">Janay Na Koi</a>
</ul>
<ul>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFQxhvQPzr8" target="_blank">My Happiness</a>
</ul>

The first song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKIsBmwI8zk" target="_blank">Balaman</a> describes the state of restlessness and remains my most heard and loved composition of the entire season. Rendered as beautifully as
it is written, so poetic!
With this song, I started listening to coke studio properly. Before it, every now and
then, my one friend or another would suggest me a song and I'd listen to
it for days. All those suggestions inspired me to follow and listen to Coke
studio properly.

Any discussion about Coke Studio Season 1 is not complete without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAhwKIPRhRE" target="_blank">Shaman Paiyan</a>. A beautiful composition, both musically and lyrically. A typical Rahat Fateh Ali Khan song and a must have in your playlist. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rLxN41avhY" target="_blank">Garaj Baras</a> is an all time hit. This recreation done here by Ali Azmat
and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is also amazing. Sometimes, you think that they
overdid it a little bit here and there but still you want to listen and
enjoy this composition.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rP337lC_cI" target="_blank">Anjane</a> sounds like a Shah Rukh Khan song where he's wandering in streets
lost in thoughts of his love. I haven't heard Strings enough but this song doesn't sound like them. I rather like their original
composition from album Duur more, listen to it <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58yEDh_s_b0" target="_blank">here</a>

Ali Zafar sounds so good when he goes retro. In retro songs he brings magic with his
melodic voice and keeping it simple in retro songs. He's done that here
and he keeps doing it. In season 8, he recreated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vPfLURfkBc" target="_blank">Ae Dil</a> with Sara Haider, and that song's gonna be in my playlist
forever.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpsSkUvlwiE" target="_blank">Allah Hu</a> is sung and performed by many artists. There are
many great renditions of this song and this is one of them.

P.S. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBQNHOC474s">Teriyaan Tu Jane</a> came to my mind when I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAbc_Oo3LyE">Paheliyan</a> from this album. Teriyaan Tu Jaane is a song by Amit Trivedi from Coke Studio @ MTv (i.e. Coke Studio India)
Season 4 and happens to be a far better composition than Paheliyan.
