Hi, Namaste, Salam!

I am a Product Engineer at <a href="http://gojek.io">Gojek Tech</a>, Bangalore based tech office of Indonesia's first Unicorn startup. Previously, I was a Software Developer at <a href="http://codeignition.co"
target="_blank">Codeignition</a>.

Sufi-mystics inspire me. I often feel connected with the
meaning of life as described in sufi songs and poetry.

Born and brought up in Bikaner, Rajasthan, IN; I did my schooling
from H.S.R. Vidyaniketan and R.S.V. Sr. Sec. School and then went on to do B.Tech in CSE from IIT Jodhpur.

During college I used to performed with a five-piece band. We wrote
a few compositions but we mostly covered other artists. I write often, mostly in Hindi. I find great depth in the writings of Ghalib. His works continue to surprise me till
this very day.

न था कुछ तो खुदा था कुछ न होता तो खुदा होता

डुबोया मुझको होने ने, न होता मैं तो क्या होता

In nothingness God was there, if naught he would persist
<br>
Existence has sunk me, what loss, if I didn't exist
