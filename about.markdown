      I am a Product Engineer at <a href="http://gojek.io">Gojek Tech</a>. I am based out of Bangalore, Karnataka. I have worked with Indonesia's first Decacorn, the SuperApp - Gojek for six years. Previously, I was a Software Developer at <a href="http://codeignition.co"
      target="_blank">Codeignition</a>. CodeIgnition, a boutique devOps
      consultancy filled with tech enthusiasts, was the best start to a career
      one could imagine.

      Sufi-mystics inspire me. I often find myself wondering about
      the meaning of life. I am
      spiritualistic and introspective in nature. While working in tech, I
      have learnt to communicate with intent. I am
      starting to get the balance of small talks and long lasting
      conversations.
      I find great depth in poetry. One of my favorite Ghalib's she'r is -
      </p>

      न था कुछ तो खुदा था कुछ न होता तो खुदा होता 
      <br>
      डुबोया मुझको होने ने, न होता मैं तो क्या होता
      <br>
      ~ ग़ालिब

      In nothingness God was there, if naught he would persist
      <br>
      Existence has sunk me, what loss, if I didn't exist
