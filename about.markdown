I am a Product Engineer at <a href="http://gojek.io">Gojek Tech</a>. I am based out of Bangalore, Karnataka. I have worked with Indonesia's first Decacorn, the SuperApp - Gojek for six years. Previously, I was a Software Developer at <a href="http://codeignition.co"
target="_blank">Codeignition</a>. CodeIgnition, a boutique devOps
consultancy filled with tech enthusiasts, was the best start to a career
one could imagine.

Sufi-mystics inspire me. I often find myself wondering about
the meaning of life. I am
spiritualistic and introspective in nature. While working in tech, I
have learnt to communicate with intent. I am
starting to get the balance of small talks and long lasting
conversations.
I find great depth in poetry. One of my favorite Ghalib's she'r is -

न था कुछ तो खुदा था कुछ न होता तो खुदा होता 
<br>
डुबोया मुझको होने ने, न होता मैं तो क्या होता
<br>
~ ग़ालिब 

In nothingness God was there, if naught he would persist
<br>
Existence has sunk me, what loss, if I didn't exist
<br>
~ Ghalib

I :heart: ideas. Let's discuss more often.

I grew up in Bikaner, Rajasthan. I took primary education in
H.S.R. Vidyaniketan. I visited Rashtra Sahayak Vidyalaya for Secondary education.
I went on to do B.Tech in CSE from IIT - Jodhpur.
