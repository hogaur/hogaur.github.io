  <p>
My name is Hari Om Gaur. My friends call me Hari.
</p>

  <p>
I am a Product Engineer at <a href="http://gojek.io">Gojek Tech</a>. I am based out of Bangalore, Karnataka. I have worked with Indonesia's first Decacorn, the SuperApp, Gojek for six years. Previously, I was a Software Developer at <a href="http://codeignition.co"
target="_blank">Codeignition</a>. CodeIgnition, a boutique devOps
consultancy filled with tech enthusiasts, was the best start to a career
one could imagine.

</p>

  <p>
I grew in Bikaner, Rajasthan. I took primary education in
H.S.R. Vidyaniketan. I visited Rashtra Sahayak Vidyalaya for Secondary education.
I went on to do B.Tech in CSE from IIT - Jodhpur, Rajasthan.

</p>

  <p>
Sufi-mystics inspire me. I often feel connected with the
meaning of life as described in sufi songs and poetry. I am
spiritualistic and introspective in nature. While working in tech, I
have learnt to communicate with intent. I didn't come easy. I am
starting to get the balance of small talks and long lasting
conversations.
</p>

  <p>

I am passionate about Music.
During college I performed with
a five-piece band. While we wrote1
a few compositions, mostly we covered some of our favourite songs. I love to journal and write my guts out. I find great depth in the writings of Ghalib. One such she'r is -
</p>

<div>
न था कुछ तो खुदा था कुछ न होता तो खुदा होता 
<br>
डुबोया मुझको होने ने, न होता मैं तो क्या होता
<br>
~ ग़ालिब 
</div>
</p>

  <p>
In nothingness God was there, if naught he would persist
<br>
Existence has sunk me, what loss, if I didn't exist
<br>
~ Ghalib
