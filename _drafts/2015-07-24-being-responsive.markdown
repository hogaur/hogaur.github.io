<h3>My experiences with bootstrap css</h3>
<p>
Recently, I worked on a website that was designed for desktops. I was
given the task of making it responsive. All the components of website
looked cool when viewed on a desktop while they all run randomly here
and there when viewed on a mobile or tablet. Image and text sizes did
not adapt as per the screen size. All components looked larger than
their anticipated sizes on smaller devices.
